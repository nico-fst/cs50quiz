## Description:
Using the knowledge gained througout the ten weeks of CS50x, this Swift code for iOS devices (tested on iPhone 14 Pro running iOS 16) builds a Single Choice QuizApp.
The questions are fetched and parsed as .json from a Firestore Database.




## Already implemented features
- [x] HomeScreen: be able to select { 5x | x∈ℤ > 0 } ≤ questions
- [x] HomeScreen: "Shake it" button triggered by physically shaking device, changes SF symbol's color
- [x] parse data from .json instead of struct within Swift
- [x] fetch data from internet: Firestore Database


## Roadmap: things I would love to implement in future
- [ ] authenticate via FireBase Auth
    - [x] login
    - [ ] logout
- [ ] extend Application to Apple Watch
- [ ] save Highscores to Firestore Database and
- [ ] QuizView: show live feedback of percentage of people clicking on each possible answer
- [ ] HomeScreen: select own .json files (from Firestore Database)
- [ ] HomeScreen: add questions to existing question .jsons
- [ ] select custom Design palette
